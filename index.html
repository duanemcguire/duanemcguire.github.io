<H1>McGuire Slide Collection</H1>
<P>In 2021, I outsourced the digitization of LaRue McGuire's slide collection.   They are now published at <BR><BR>
<a href="https://pics.duanemcguire.com">pics.duanemcguire.com</a><BR><BR>
For family members and friends, I encourage participation to better document this collection.  You may view the collection without registering, but to comment 
and tag photos you will need to be a registered user.  You may register here:<BR><BR>
<a href="https://pics.duanemcguire.com/register.php">Register</a><BR><BR>
The registration is also found on the lower left corner of the desktop site.</p>

<p>
You will find that the desktop site is more feature-rich, but the mobile version is nice for simple photo viewing.  If you wish to install a viewing app for your tablet or phone, 
look for "PIWIGO" in the app store.
</p>

<P>
I hope you enjoy this collection.  It is published initially with many known errors, because the collection includes nearly 2000 slides.   When digitizing the slides, 
I submitted them in packages of 50.  When specifying a date for the slides, I selected one slide from each package where I could read a date, and marked all slides in that
package with the date I read.   That resulted in many correct dates, but is no way correct for all.   If you find a date errors, please leave a suggested year/month in the comment 
area for that photo.   Another known error is that some later slides are actually from Duane and Terri's collection, not LaRue's.  I'll be working to separate those.

<p>
I look forward to your participation in this project!<BR><<BR>
